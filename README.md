# Smart Electrical Fault Diagnosis & Protection System Using Arduino and Proteus
## 🔧 Project Overview
An intelligent **Arduino-based electrical fault diagnosis and protection system** designed for three-phase power networks. The system monitors critical electrical parameters in real time and detects common and hazardous faults to improve safety, reliability, and operational efficiency.
The project combines **embedded systems**, **power engineering**, and **Proteus simulation** to deliver an end-to-end solution from design and validation to implementation.
## ⚡ Key Features
* Real-time monitoring of **voltage, current, frequency, and phase sequence**
* Detection of electrical faults:
  * Phase loss
  * Phase sequence error
  * Over-voltage & under-voltage
  * Overload & overheating
  * Fire and temperature hazards
* Automatic protection logic and fault indication
* Visual alerts using **LCD, LEDs, and buzzer**
## 🧩 System Architecture
The system follows a **modular design**, consisting of:
* Phase sequence monitoring module
* Phase loss detection module
* Voltage monitoring module (over/under voltage)
* Frequency measurement module
* Temperature & fire detection module
* Protection delay and logic control module
* Arduino-based control unit
* User interface (LCD display & indicators)

Each module was independently designed, tested, and integrated into the full system.
